# Kivy Task Tracker

A lightweight daily task tracker built with **Python** and **Kivy** for desktop (Windows/Linux/Mac).

You can add unlimited tasks, track time spent on each task with a start/stop timer, write descriptions of your work, navigate between different days, and delete tasks with confirmation. All data is stored locally in JSON format and can be viewed day-by-day.
